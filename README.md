# Messenger-Visualization
Simple graphic of a Facebook Messenger group chat with my friends.

Data is extracted from Facebook using the [Download My Data](https://www.facebook.com/help/302796099745838) feature on Facebook. It is then parsed to JSON with a simple Python script and visualized using D3.js.

Messages span 2015-09-14 (creation of group chat) to 2017-11-19
